# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Report Bugs or Request Features

If you are reporting a bug, please fill the form and try to include:

If you are proposing a feature:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. The pull request should work for Python 3.11
