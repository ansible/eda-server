"""Initialize scheduled tasks and run scheduler.

When executed this management command will delete existing scheduled
tasks, add new tasks according to settings and execute RQ scheduler.

Jobs are configured in three lists:
    * Startup jobs (``RQ_STARTUP_JOBS``) – one-time jobs executed at
        scheduler startup time.
    * Periodic jobs (``RQ_PERIODIC_JOBS``) – jobs executed repeatedly
        with fixed time interval.
    * Cron jobs (``RQ_CRON_JOBS``) – jobs, defined by a crontab string.

Startup jobs.

Example::

  RQ_STARTUP_JOBS = [
      {
          "func": "package.module.funcname",
          "scheduled_time": datetime(2020, 1, 1),
      }
  ]


Periodic jobs.

Example::

    RQ_PERIODIC_JOBS = [
        {
            # Function to be queued
            "func": "package.module.funcname",
            # Time before the function is called again (in seconds).
            "interval": 60,
            # Time for first execution, in UTC timezone
            ...
        }
    ]

https://github.com/rq/rq-scheduler/blob/master/README.rst

Cron jobs.

Example::

    RQ_CRON_JOBS = [
        {
            # Function to be queued
            "func": "package.module.funcname",
            # A cron string
            "cron_string": "0 0 * * 0",
        }
    ]
